[Codecademy Course: Build Web Apps With React] - Project: Jamming
- A web application that uses the Spotify API to allow users to search for music and create new playlist based on the search results. The newly created playlists will be shown on the Spotify account.

# Summary
- This project is the Capstone project of Codecademy Create a [Front-End App with React](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-web-apps-with-react). This course served as my introduction to React. I did this project two times since the first time I finished it I felt I was not really understanding what was going since I was not able to put enough time into due my internship work and other projects I was working on after work. After my internship was over, I decided to do this project again. I am glad I did this as now I have a better understand and found a love for React.
- Also, I learned how to deploy this website using Surge. Surge is great tool that allows easy deployment of simple, single-command web publishing. I will start using this for my projects.

# Instructions
